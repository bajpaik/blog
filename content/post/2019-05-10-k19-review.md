I was very lucky to get to go to Knowledge19.  Now that it's over, before I leave I want to jot down my thoughts.
Of the labs, I attended I had no technical difficulty with the wifi or content.  Others did, but somehow not me.

<!--more-->

Below I'll go over the parts I think notable.

Last year I went over the things to keep in mind, but here's a link to the [k18 post](/k18) for a refresher.

This year was different in that I was a speaker about the Meetups I help run.  You can see the ones local to you [here](https://www.meetup.com/pro/servicenowdevprogram/).

I got a lot out of this so I'll get the boring bits out of the way;

## Registration

Looks like they used g2planet.com again and this year it was better than last.  This I thought was okay, but it could be improved.  It also didnt help that the schedule kept changing after I had been signed up for things.

## Mobile App

This years app was much better.  It could have been better but it worked for its purpose.  

## Social Stuff

This was great.  I had been invited out to two nights out and met a ton of people.  See [Twitter](https://twitter.com/phxdev/status/1125984190359465985) for more details.  Drai's party was pretty great.  A bit loud, but that's expected being a night club and all.

## Labs

### CCW1630 Extension points: How to get other developers to improve your app

@pheedbaq is the man behind this lab.  It was really well done.  He had us update a bike borrowing application.  I don't think I can properly explain this but, in short this is what I think it is.   A better way to let others replace code in a scope.

### CCB1089 Making the most of the ServiceNow MID Server

This was amazing and performed by Mark Scott.  I'm not sure how much he practiced it, but he came off like a pro.  This talk checked all the boxes in my opinion.

It was Entertaining, Educational, and Actionable.  Not to mention he used R to determine if a photo is a hotdog or not a hotdog just like they did in Silicon Valley on HBO.  

In my opinion this was the best session I went to.  (If you all have a recording of this on youtube let me know and I'll add a link.)

### CCB1419 ServiceNow Developer Meetup and community Building

This was a really open discussion between 
[Andrew Barnes](https://www.meetup.com/RDU-ServiceNow-Developer-Meetup/members/215745765/profile/), 
[Lily Li](https://www.meetup.com/Orlando-ServiceNow-Developer-Meetup/members/212809016/profile), 
[Todd Volpe](https://www.meetup.com/South-Florida-ServiceNow-Developer-Meetup/members/189027559/profile/), 
[Melhem El-Achkar](https://www.meetup.com/Munchen-ServiceNow-Developer-Meetup/members/203263765/profile/),
and [Fernando Luiz Goulart](https://www.meetup.com/Sao-Paulo-ServiceNow-Developer-Meetup/members/189217600/profile/).

It was great.  We all introduced ourselves and talked about the stuggles and the best way to do things in the meetup.  I had been due to talk on the 1st floor 1/2 way through this talk.  One of the attendees followed me down and I met her after my talk.  She's from Mexico and wants to have one in her area.  I hope it starts up.  I'd love to go and see it happen.

### BRE1340 - A city in the cloud: How Minneapolis is driving digital transformation on the Now Platform

I lived in Minnneapolis and know the speaker and some of the developers who did a lot of the work featured in this talk.

I just have this to say about the talk.  Gina F. did a great job!  I loved the slide where you could here her passion for the city.

Also all the business problems they solved were amazing.
